##  Retry Mechanism (API Failover Simulation)

To simulate an API retry scenario, we intercept the first transaction request and force it to fail with a 500 status. On the next attempt, we allow it to proceed successfully.

This demonstrates that the UI:
- Handles API failures gracefully
- Retries the request after failure (manually or automatically)
- Notifies the user if retry fails again

Example logic in `api-validator.js`:

```js
let attemptCount = 0;
page.route('**/api/transactions', async (route) => {
  attemptCount++;
  if (attemptCount === 1) {
    await route.fulfill({ status: 500, body: 'Internal Server Error' });
  } else {
    await route.continue();
  }
});
```

You can assert the retry by counting how many times the endpoint is hit or monitoring UI retry behavior.
