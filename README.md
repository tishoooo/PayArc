## 🌐 Web UI Automation (Playwright)

- Covers:
  - ✅ Login flow
  - 💸 Transaction creation
  - 🕓 Transaction history
  - 🔄 UI + API consistency
- Organized using Page Object Model
- Easily extendable and scalable

📄 Details: [`web-tests/README.md`](web-tests/README.md)

---

## 📱 Mobile Automation Strategy (Appium)

- Focused on React Native apps
- Describes test flows, toolchain, and best practices
- Sample pseudocode provided using WebDriverIO

📄 Details: [`mobile-tests/README.md`](mobile-tests/README.md)

---

## 🔄 API Validation

- Playwright’s `waitForResponse` is used to validate API response data
- Ensures UI reflects accurate transaction status and values
- Located in: `web-tests/utils/api-validator.js`

---

## ⚡ Performance Testing (k6)

- Simulates concurrent users performing transactions
- Validates backend/API response times under load
- Helps identify performance regressions and bottlenecks

📄 Details: [`load-tests/README.md`](load-tests/README.md)

---

## ✅ Highlights

- 🔹 Cross-platform test design
- 🔹 Clean, scalable code structure
- 🔹 API-aware and performance-driven
- 🔹 CI/CD-ready layout

This setup demonstrates not just automation, but a complete QA mindset.
