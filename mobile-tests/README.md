# 📱 Mobile UI Automation Strategy with Appium (React Native)

## 🎯 Goal
Design a scalable and maintainable mobile test automation framework using **Appium** to validate critical flows in a React Native mobile app for financial transactions.

---

## 🛠️ Why Appium?
- Open-source & cross-platform (iOS + Android)
- Native support for React Native apps
- Allows use of WebDriver protocol (Selenium-like syntax)
- Supports device farm integration (BrowserStack, Sauce Labs)

---

## 🔍 Key Test Scenarios

### 🔐 Login
- Valid login
- Invalid login (error message)
- Session timeout and re-login

### 💸 Transaction Flow
- Create new transaction (amount, recipient, currency)
- Validate UI success confirmation
- Verify transaction appears in history

### 🔁 Real-time API Feedback
- Dynamic UI update based on API response (status badge, retry button)
- Offline / retry flow handling

### 📜 Transaction History
- Load and scroll through past transactions
- Validate presence and details of specific items
- Pull-to-refresh behavior

---

## 📱 Device/Platform Support
- Android Emulator (API 30+)
- iOS Simulator (Xcode 14+)
- Real devices via Appium CLI or cloud providers

---

## 📦 Tools & Dependencies
- Appium (`appium`, `appium-doctor`, `appium-uiautomator2-driver`)
- WebDriverIO (or Mocha + WD)
- Appium Inspector (element locator)
- `adb`, `Xcode`, or cloud service

---

## 🔄 API Validation (Optional)
- Capture and validate network traffic using proxy tools (e.g., BrowserMob Proxy or Charles)
- Correlate UI status with API transaction status (e.g., `processing`, `success`)

---

## 🧪 Sample Test (Pseudocode)

```js
describe('Transaction Test', () => {
  it('should create and validate transaction', async () => {
    await LoginScreen.login('user@example.com', 'pass123');
    await TransactionScreen.createTransaction(100, 'john@example.com');
    await expect(TransactionScreen.successMessage).toBeVisible();
    await HistoryScreen.open();
    await expect(HistoryScreen.findTransaction(100)).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

## 📊 Performance Monitoring in Mobile

Appium supports capturing performance-related logs and metrics to analyze how the app behaves under load or during transitions.

### 📌 Android
- `driver.getPerformanceData()` allows you to retrieve:
  - CPU usage
  - Memory usage
  - Network data
  - Battery stats
- Requires setting performance logging capabilities and using UiAutomator2

### 📌 iOS
- Appium doesn't support `getPerformanceData`, but logs can be captured via:
  - `syslog` from the device
  - Xcode Instruments or third-party monitoring tools (e.g., Firebase Performance)

### 🔍 Additional Monitoring Tools
- Cloud-based device labs like **BrowserStack** or **Sauce Labs** provide performance logs and insights
- You can integrate external APM tools to track frontend app responsiveness

### ✅ Use Cases
- Detecting slowness in rendering transaction history
- Verifying app performance with 20+ concurrent users
- Logging performance regressions after releases

---

## ✅ Best Practices
- Use selectors with accessibility labels (`testID` in React Native)
- Use deep linking to skip login when needed
- Run tests on real devices/emulators during CI
- Use retry logic for flaky operations

---

## 📌 Summary
This Appium-based strategy allows scalable automation of React Native mobile apps, covering login, transaction flows, history validation, performance and UI-API consistency — all critical for financial systems.
